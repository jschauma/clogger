SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     clogger writes input to the specified Campfire room(s).

OPTIONS
     clogger supports the following options:

     -D	       Run in debug mode.  No messages will actually be sent to Camp-
	       fire.

     message   The message to send to the given room(s); if not specified,
	       read input from stdin.

DETAILS
     clogger writes the given message to the specified Campfire room(s).  It
     prefixes any messages with the username of the invoking user as well as
     the (short) hostname on which it is running.  If the input consists of
     multiple lines, then clogger delivers the input as a "PasteMessage" to
     the Campfire API.

CONFIGURATION
     By default, clogger reads its configuration from the file
     /etc/clogger.conf.	 In this file, you can specify the following key-
     word=value pairs:

     campfire_host   The hostname for Campfire API access.

     proxy_url	     The URL of the HTTP proxy to use, if any.

     proxy_user	     The username to authenticate to the HTTP proxy, if any.

     proxy_pass	     The password to authenticate to the HTTP proxy, if any.

	   echo "Good news, everybody!" | clogger -r 1234
